# Kaggle-Digit-Recognizer

After learning neural network, I start to try this project <digit recognizer>.

Here is a log about the process of my project:

2018.9.12

(1) Load data and build my baseline model.

(2) Use keras framework to build convolution neural network (cnn) to do predicting.

(3) Future plan: adjust hyper-parameters in the model.

improve the structure of neural network.

try to use could platform to accelerate the training and testing and reduce the time of it.
